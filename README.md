# Data Science

As I start my journey in data science, I will continuously update this repository to document my learning. This repository will be divided into the following sections: featured projects, data science learning notes, and other special topics.

The goal of this repository is to summarize and organize my knowledge for machine learning. All the codes will be written in Jupyter Notebook format, and should be reproducible by either cloning or downloading the whole repository. The content of the notebook aims to strike a good balance between background knowledge, mathematical formulations, naive algorithm implementation (via numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), and sophisticated implementation through open-source library.

## Tableau Visualization
Data Visualization is a critical skill not only for data exploration but also for the decision making processes, and Tableau is one of the most widely used software for visualization. As such, starting from April 2020 I deicde to put aside one hour weekly to create hone my visualization skills and find unique insights from data.

[Workout Wednesday](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/) is a weekly data visualization challenge to help anyone interested in data visualization to build on the skills in Tableau. Each Wednesday a challenge is release and participants are asked to replicate the challenge that is posed as closely as possible. Thanks to this wonderful community, there are numerous resources that we can learn visualization from.

Check out my [Tableau Public Gallery](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yung.tang.chou#!/) if you are interesed in more informative visualization!
