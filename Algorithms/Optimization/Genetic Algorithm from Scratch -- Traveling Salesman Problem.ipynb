Generally speaking, we can generate a population that contains some portion of the entire feasible solutions. If there is no better solution throughout the current population, Evolutionary Algorithms are able to crossover and mutate and generate new solutions that might be better than all in the current population.

    "Genetic Algorithm is a heuristic approach learned from biology. In general, **evolutionary algorithms, including genetic algorithms, belong to the non-deterministic class of algorithms, thereby not guaranteeing optimal solution**. However, it can find a good solution that is at least not too far away from the optimal. To look for the best result, you can concatenate your genetic algorithm with a local search algorithm to explore the neighborhood more.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **`Stochastic`**: Usually evolutionary algorithms have a large stochastic component in the algorithm itself. Therefore, you need to find a statistical convergent solution with many more simulations. This should be taken into account if you only have limited amount of time, as the more generation in each algorithm (more time spent on one try), the better the output will be.\n",

In the meantime, those solutions can have a better way of explaining why the algorithm behaves this way, whereas the genetic algorithm is simply randomly guessing and exploring the entire solution space it has.\n",
